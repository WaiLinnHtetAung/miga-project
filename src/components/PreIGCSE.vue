                        Pre-IGCSE, also known as Pre-International General Certificate of Secondary Education, is an educational program that serves as a preparatory stage for students before they undertake the IGCSE examinations. It is typically offered to students in grades 7 to 9 or years 8 to 10, depending on the educational system. During the Pre-IGCSE phase, students engage in a comprehensive curriculum that covers various subjects, including Mathematics, English, Science, Social Sciences, Languages, and Humanities. The curriculum aims to provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge and skills necessary for their further studies.
